# Cursor AI Instructions - Secure PII Management System Challenge

> **Language**: All content in this file MUST be in English. Keep all instructions, comments, and documentation in English for consistency.

## Project Context

This is a **take-home engineering challenge** for a job application. The goal is to build a secure PII management system with:

- **Rails application** (Ruby on Rails 8): Web interface for collecting and displaying PII data
- **Java microservice** (Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.2): SSN validation service per SSA standards

**Working Methodology**: Small, focused PRs - each implementing a single feature with tests.

---

## Critical Requirements to Remember

### SSN Validation Rules (Java Service)
The Java microservice must validate SSN per SSA standards:
- Format: XXX-XX-XXXX (9 digits with dashes)
- Area number (first 3 digits):
  - Cannot be 000 or 666
  - 900-999 IS VALID (used for ITINs)
- Group number (middle 2 digits): Cannot be 00
- Serial number (last 4 digits): Cannot be 0000
- Must reject known invalid test SSNs:
  - 078-05-1120 (Social Security Administration's public example)
  - 219-09-9999 (known invalid)
  - 457-55-5462 (known invalid)

### Security Implementation
- **At Rest**: SSN encrypted in PostgreSQL using Rails encrypted attributes
- **In Transit**: Document HTTPS/TLS (not required for local dev)
- **Display**: SSN masked as `***-**-1234` (only last 4 digits visible)
- **Important**: Masking happens in Rails presentation layer, NOT in Java service
- Java service is internal service-to-service, not exposed to end users

### Architecture
- **Monorepo structure**:
  - `/rails-app` - Rails application
  - `/java-service` - Java Spring Boot microservice
- Services communicate via HTTP REST
- Docker Compose orchestrates all services
- PostgreSQL database

### PII Form Fields
Rails form must collect:
- First Name (required, 1-50 chars)
- Middle Name (required, 1-50 chars)
- Middle Name Override (checkbox for users without middle name)
- Last Name (required, 1-50 chars)
- Social Security Number (required, XXX-XX-XXXX format)
- Address:
  - Street Address 1 (required)
  - Street Address 2 (optional)
  - City (required)
  - State (required, 2-letter abbreviation)
  - ZIP Code (required, 5 digits)

### Testing Requirements
- **Rails**: RSpec with >70% code coverage
  - Model validations
  - Controller/request specs
  - Integration tests for Java service communication
  - Test encryption/decryption
- **Java**: JUnit 5 with >70% code coverage
  - Unit tests for SSN validation logic
  - API endpoint tests

## Development Guidelines

### When Writing Code
1. **Test First**: Every feature needs tests
2. **Single Responsibility**: One PR = One feature
3. **Security First**: Always encrypt PII, validate inputs
4. **Documentation**: Update README/ARCHITECTURE.md when needed

### Code Style
- **Rails**: Follow standard Rails conventions, use RSpec for tests
- **Java**: Spring Boot best practices, JUnit 5 for tests
- **Keep it simple**: Functional over beautiful UI
- **No React**: Use Rails views (ERB) with Tailwind CSS

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests BEFORE or ALONGSIDE implementation
- Test both happy paths and error cases
- Integration tests for service-to-service communication
- Mock external service calls when appropriate

### Common Patterns
- Rails calls Java service for SSN validation before saving
- Java service returns validation result (true/false + error message if invalid)
- Rails encrypts SSN before storing in database
- Display layer masks SSN when rendering views

## PR/Branch Workflow

### ✅ CHECKLIST for Every PR/Branch

Before completing any PR, ensure you have:

#### 1. **Tests/Specs** (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Written RSpec tests for Rails features (models, controllers, services)
- [ ] Written JUnit tests for Java features
- [ ] Verified tests pass: `bundle exec rspec` or `mvn test`
- [ ] Coverage meets >70% threshold
- [ ] Tests include both happy paths AND error cases

#### 2. **Documentation Updates** (AS NEEDED)
Check if these files need updates:

- [ ] **README.md** - Update if:
  - New feature affects setup/installation
  - New environment variables added
  - New commands or endpoints created
  - Project status/progress changes
  - Implementation status checklist needs updating

- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Update if:
  - New service or component added
  - Communication pattern changes
  - Database schema modified
  - Security implementation changes

- [ ] **.cursorrules** - Update if:
  - New patterns or conventions established
  - Project checklist items completed
  - New guidelines or rules needed

- [ ] **CHALLENGE.md** - ⚠️ Never modify (original requirements)

- [ ] **Code comments** - Add for:
  - Complex business logic
  - Security-critical sections
  - Non-obvious design decisions

#### 3. **Code Quality**
- [ ] No linter errors introduced
- [ ] Follow Rails/Java conventions
- [ ] Secure handling of PII data
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

#### 4. **Commit Message**
- [ ] Clear, descriptive message
- [ ] Follows pattern: "Add/Update/Fix [feature/component]"

### 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting tests** - Every PR must have tests
2. **Not updating README** - If feature is user-facing, document it
3. **Incomplete implementation** - Finish what you start in a PR
4. **Multiple features in one PR** - Keep PRs focused and small
5. **Not updating the checklist** - Mark items as complete in `.cursorrules`

## Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Rails app with PII collection form
- [ ] Java microservice with SSN validation
- [ ] PostgreSQL with encrypted SSN storage
- [ ] Display page with masked SSNs
- [ ] Docker Compose setup
- [ ] Tests with >70% coverage (both services)
- [ ] README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md with design decisions

---

## Important Notes

- **AI Usage**: Document use of AI tools (this is encouraged!)
- **Assumptions**: Document all assumptions in README.md
- **Quality over Quantity**: Working, well-tested core features > broken complete implementation
- **Time Tracking**: Keep track of time spent for self-assessment

---

## Current Project Status

Check git history for completed PRs. Each PR should be focused and include:
1. Implementation
2. Tests
3. Documentation updates (if needed)

When suggesting new features, consider what's already been implemented in previous PRs.
